## Credits

This project:

1. Uses the [Mediawiki API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page).
2. Looks great because of [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) and illustrations from [unDraw](https://undraw.co/illustrations).
3. Was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
